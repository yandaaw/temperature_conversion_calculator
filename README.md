# Temperature Conversion Calculator

# About The Project
The main focus of working on this project is to create a temperature calculator that can convert any temperature ratio from Celsius, Kelvin, Reamur, to Fahrenheit. This project was created in the [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) programming language

# Screen Capture of The Program
The following is a display of the temperature calculator program which consists of a number of menus. Each menu can be selected and can run each command to convert the temperature from one unit to others. For example, we want to know the conversion from 32 degrees Reamur to other units, then we can choose menu 1 in the program.

### **The program's temperature calculator is displayed in the main menu.**
